# SDH_variables
This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks containing scripts written to manipulate and prepare Social Determinants of Health (SDH) variables.

This dataset was created for a project only focused on New York City.  However some data sources, such as the American Community Survey and Social Vulnerability Index (CDC), can be expanded to other cities and states.
