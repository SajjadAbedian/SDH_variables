# SDH_variables
This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks containing scripts written to manipulate and prepare Social Determinants of Health (SDH) variables.

This dataset was created for a project only focused on New York City.  However some data sources, such as the American Community Survey, Air Quality (Respiratory Hazard Index) from EPA, and Social Vulnerability Index from CDC, can be expanded to other cities and states.
